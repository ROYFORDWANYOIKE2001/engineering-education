 ### Build Your Own Keys 
 Security is one of the most crucial things in organizations. This starts with how the entire organizations handle their data. This article will be handling Building Your Own Keys for use in organizations. Moreover, an added advantage without third parties involved. It will show using Azure. But, other services are offering BYOK like Google. 

### Introduction
  Information honesty shapes something essential in a venture. Thus, in giving and taking, an association feels like it is back to begin line once more. Information break has turned into an imperative and everyday talk in the current. This is in conjunction with programmers releasing a great deal of information. This is because weak encryption or even unstable information ends up in risky hands. The launch of BYOK gives premises a chance to create their keys. Moreover, they will have authority over the whole key and sharing cycle. Utilizing wealthy and alter safe gadgets will be the best way to reinforce security. These gadgets will deal with a standard of the equipment security module. This is because they will assist ensure the safety of the keys. For a more secure information store, consider carrying out Bring Your Own Key, where you will be the pilot.

### Pre-requisites 
- Data Encryption in the Cloud
- Troubleshooting BYOKS 
- Conclusion 

### Getting Started 
Using good and tamper-resistant devices become the only way to strengthen security. This is because these devices will work on a principle of the hardware security module. This principle will help keep track of the secure export of all keys generated. For a safer data store, consider implementing Bring Your Own Key, where you will be the pilot. Security in most organizations has been getting weak daily as technology advances. There are many cybersecurity experts, both ethical and unethical today. They are working hard to try to break the codes. Thus the need resulted in bringing your own key mechanism. 
### How is BYOK different from HYOK?
In BYOK, the organizations have the full mandate to secure and keep the keys to their own. This is what has been helping them to ensure they have privacy. Using this, they can track all the ongoing activities. Some companies have ended up uploading the encryption keys to the cloud service. There is a definite solution to them now. BYOK has reduced third parties, which increases the risk of data access. Moreover, organizations track their hardware devices on how they communicate with others—

### Importance of Introducing BYOKs 
1. Data security and integrity are critical in an organization. This is because it will show the authenticity of the data held.
2. Data breaches can result in a loss of revenue and the loss of clients owing to a lack of confidence.
3. Bring Your Own Key is a topology controlled at the individual level. It does not rely on a third party outside the organization to keep data.
 
 ### Requirements
 1. Knowledge about cloud computing
 2. An editor was installed. I would recommend [visual studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
 3. A basic understanding of programming. 
 4. A Microsoft account that can be created [here](https://account.microsoft.com/account/ ) 

### Data Encryption in the Cloud 
To develop BYOK, there are crypto libraries. The main aim is to generate the keys. These keys are randomized in a way that they are encrypted. The generated keys concern the compatible certificate. The generated certificate, once compatible, has a unique secret key. Moreover, HSMs aids in ensuring availability through the use of tough key management. They have to have efficient storage and avoid redundancy features. This is what generates the asymmetric keys for use. To grant rights to the user, the following commands are used on the shell or terminal. These are in line when working with azure keys 

```shell az keyvault role assignment 
create 
--hsm-name "ContosoMHSM" -
-role "Managed HSM Crypto User" 
--assignee 00000019-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 --scope /keys/contosomhsmkey 
``` 

Configuring the azure information protection to use we need keys. Run the following commands on the terminal:
 
 ```
 bash Connect-Api Service 
 ``` 
 
To specify the URL run the following commands in the terminal or shell: 
 
 ```bash
 bash Use-AipServiceKeyVaultKey -KeyVaultKeyUrl "/url goes in here <key-version> " 
 ``` 

### Troubleshooting BYOKs
There are only two reasons why these keys might end up conflicting. These are due to validation and tampering. For instance, working with azure keys it is possible to troubleshoot. It is also easy to check where the errors are and in case of invalid dueness then a renew is the only solution. in the link, the part enters the licensing URL. 
```
bash LicensingIntranetDistributionPointUrl:
``` 
Many companies are still unveiling the best BOOKS. Recently, Google, too, has come up with its system. They recently released it in beta mode and named it Cloud External Key Manager. The mission of their system is to help enterprises leverage Google cloud services. Secondly, to follow the complex regulations and policies. These regulations will be giving them the mandate to control their keys. Additionally, they will encrypt and maintain ownership. ​

### Conclusion 
According to data analysis and mining, BYOKS is all about how data is established and handled. This helps to maintain trust while working with data. Moreover, where the hosting has been done remotely. This is because remote data handling has several challenges that can land in bad hands. ​
